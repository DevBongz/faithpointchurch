[00:17:00.489] Server  ERROR   (node:26198) Warning: SECURITY WARNING: The SSL modes 'prefer', 'require', and 'verify-ca' are treated as aliases for 'verify-full'.
In the next major version (pg-connection-string v3.0.0 and pg v9.0.0), these modes will adopt standard libpq semantics, which have weaker security guarantees.

To prepare for this change:
- If you want the current behavior, explicitly use 'sslmode=verify-full'
- If you want libpq compatibility now, use 'uselibpqcompat=true&sslmode=require'

See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html for libpq SSL mode definitions.
